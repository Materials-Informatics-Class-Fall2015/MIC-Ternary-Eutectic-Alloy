## Some Definitions

Here are some definitions that will be helpful in understanding the background of this project and proir work.

**Ternary Eutectic System** - a system of three components, in which one phase is changed into three other phases at a certain temperature and ratio of the three components. For this project, a phase of liquid solution of Al, Ag, and Cu will be transformed into three phases Al, Al<sub>2</sub>Cu, and Ag<sub>2</sub>Al.

In this alloy, the eutectic ratios by mole fraction are 0.18 Ag, 0.69 Al, and 0.13 Cu at 773.6 K.

**Ternary Phase Diagram** - a 2- or 3-dimensional phase diagram that represents concentrations and phases of three components (a,b,c) in an equilateral trangle. There are four external variables that constitute a complete representation of a ternary system, ratio of any two components, temperature, and pressure. However, the ternary phase diagrams usually are depict while one or two of the variable are kept constant. (How to read ternary phase diagrams, [here](https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/Petrology/Teutect.htm))

**Directional solidification** - a process of solidification within castings where the liquid metal solidifies in one direction and the interface of solidifying metal is always in contact with liquid metal.

## Features in Ag-Al-Cu Microstructure

The phases are represented in this way in the below micrograph of an actual Ag-Al-Cu alloy:

* Al - black 
* Al<sub>2</sub>Cu - grey
* Ag<sub>2</sub>Al - white

As the temperature of the liquid solution decreases, solid phases begin to form in the alloy. These phases do not necessarily form at the same time. The phase with the higher concentration will crystalize first and then the phase with next highest concentration will be next to solidify. 

As the solution is solidified, the three phases form patterns, most notable a brick-like chains of  Ag<sub>2</sub>Al (white) and Al<sub>2</sub>Cu (grey). The patterns can be categorized in six distinct features:

* a) Concave interfaces from Ag<sub>2</sub>Al to Al<sub>2</sub>Cu
* b) Triple interface between Ag<sub>2</sub>Al and  Al<sub>2</sub>Cu
* c) Loop of Ag<sub>2</sub>Al and  Al<sub>2</sub>Cu chain
* d) V-shaped formation of Ag<sub>2Al phase within Ag<sub>2</sub>Al and  Al<sub>2</sub>Cu chain
* e) Al<sub>2</sub>Cu phase at end of Ag<sub>2</sub>Al and  Al<sub>2</sub>Cu chain
* f) Sign of curvature variation between Ag<sub>2</sub>Al and  Al<sub>2</sub>Cu phases

Finally, to visualize directional solidification, the following picture is a growth of the phases (left-to-right). In this case, the phases are colored the following way:

* Al - red
* Al<sub>2</sub>Cu - blue
* Ag<sub>2</sub>Al - green
