##Project Objectives
Create a model linking our simulated process data with a representation of the steady-state microstructures.

###Description
Our data is a product of a phase field simulations on the microstructure evolution in directional solidification of a aluminum-silver-copper ternary eutectoid alloy. The data consists of 21 datasets, while each dataset contains the microstructure infomation through time, from beginning of simulation to steady state. The simulations include varied concentrations and solidification velocities, but the same initial microstructure.

##Dataset
The data consist of 21 simulation results datasets, each dataset is 301 microstructure images with 800x800 pixel resolution. For each simulation, the concentration of Al, Ag, and Cu, and solidification velocities is specified. The microstructure image data is can be characterize in the following way 21x301x800x800 in terms of pixel information. Below is a tabulated display of the process parameters:

The microstructure consists of 3 phases, Al, Al-Ag, and Al-Cu. Here's an example of a single simulation from our dataset.

##Collaboration

##Challenges
There were fewer process (input) variables into the simulation than we expected, which would be helpful in creating a process-structure model. There are only two process parameters that were available to us: concentration and solidification velocity. Since concentration of Al was always constant, concentration of either Ag or Cu would be sufficient to know the concentration of the whole material.

Other challenges.




##2 Point Statistics
We extracted 2-point spatial correlation statistics for our data.  We assumed a periodic boundary condition for both the x- and y-axis. These statistics will become the per-sample measurements we reduce via PCA. We utilized pyMKS for our pipeline. The following figure shows a single visualzed spatial correlation:

##2 Point Statistics Optimization
Each 2-point statistic is an 800x800 field showing phase-phase correlations. Not all of this region is likely to be statistically meaningful, so we investigated which resolutions of 2-pt statistics offered a good balance between computational speed and accuracy. The truncation is done symmetrically, which is consistent with a our periodic assumption.

The following plot demonstrates the amount of statistically significant measurements in the cut region.

##Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
We used PCA to reduce the large 2-pt statistics to a low rank representation.
Our data exhibit reasonable variance falloff.

##PCA Optimization
We also investigated which pairs of correlations perform best with our entire pipeline.
Since we have only three phases, we know that the entirety of the correlations can be calculated from two of them.
We chose to run the pipeline for all pairs of correlations and use the pair with best final model performance (minimal MSE).

This is a huge space savings for the PCA step.

##Final PCA Results - Steady State

Wild oscillations occur in our data until the early 120s. For our steady-state investigation, we do not use any of the microstructures in the first 150 frames.

##Process-Property Linkage Model
We tried multiple models to predict the linkage between process parameters and 2-point statistics.
Here are the final MSE scores for several optimized models.
